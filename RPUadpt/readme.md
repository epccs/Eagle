Shield for multidrop RS-422 with management for open source serial bootloaders.

This circuit board started with a simple point to point RS-422, e.g. it was not multidrop or fail-safe. The DTR pair was just a differential pair to run the DTR signal to the remote board so it could capacitively bump the reset and bootload (e.g. like Arduino Uno does). It has grown more powerful than I had any anticipation of.
