[MacGyver]

This folder has the Eagle files for the MacGyver board. To use it program the AVR128DB32 (manager) with UPDI from R-Pi header. Once the manager is programmed, the AVR128DA28 (application) can be programmed with UPDI over the multidrop serial from any connected host (e.g., other boards with an R-Pi or RPUusb).
