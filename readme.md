# Eagle Circuit Board Files

Eagle is software for Computer Aided Design (CAD) of printed circuit boards. Eagle was once owned by a company from Germany called Cadsoft but is now owned by Autodesk (Autocad).

# Rant

Autodesk has a long and craptacular history, they are no friend of Open Source anything. I have been spin looping the idea of having my hardware files in the repository I use for software for some time. When I put the Eagle file in with the C files the main description for the repository shows it to be Eagle. I do not want that, it is like putting the flag of an ideology I do not align with on the repository. Anyway, I will put the hardware files in this repository, and then I can build my KiCAD skills so someday I can do boards without looking at the flag of craptacular.
