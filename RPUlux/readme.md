# RPUlux

This circuit board has six 330mA LED channels each done with AL8805W5-7, it uses the ATmega328p's six PWM pins to control the switch mode current sources that can be enabled and disabled at 500Hz. A few pins also go to other connectors and allow some digital input-output or analog input options. The IO is also level shifted to work with the two onboard current sources.
