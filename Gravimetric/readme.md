[Gravimetric]

This circuit board has a general-purpose ATmega324pb for control applications; it also has ATmega328pb manager. It is the first board on which I have abandoned the Arduino headers and went with an SBC (Raspberry Pi pinout) header. The integrated RPUbus allows the host to interface with (and bootload) my other controllers.
